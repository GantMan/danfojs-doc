#### Where to start?

All contributions, bug reports, bug fixes, documentation improvements, enhancements, and ideas are welcome.

For first time contributors, you can find pending issues on the GitHub “issues” page. There are a number of issues listed and "good first issue" where you could start out. Once you’ve found an interesting issue, and have an improvement in mind, next thing is to set up your development environment.

#### Working with the code

Now that you have an issue you want to fix, enhancement to add, or documentation to improve, you need to learn how to work with GitHub and the datasist code base.

**Version control, Git, and GitHub**

The datasist code is hosted on GitHub. To contribute you will need to sign up for a free GitHub account. We use Git for version control to allow many people to work together on this project.

Some great resources for learning Git:

* Official [GitHub pages](http://help.github.com).

**Getting started with Git¶**

Find [Instructions](http://help.github.com/set-up-git-redirect) for installing git, setting up your SSH key, and configuring git. These steps need to be completed before you can work seamlessly between your local repository and GitHub.

**Forking the datasist repo**

You will need your own fork to work on the code. Go to the datasist [project page](https://github.com/risenW/datasist) and hit the Fork button.

Next, you will clone your fork to your local machine:

```text
    git clone https://github.com/your-user-name/datasist.git
```

This creates the directory datasist and connects your repository to the upstream \(main project\) repository.

**Creating a development environment**

To test out code changes, you’ll need to build datasist from source, which requires a Python environment.

**Creating a Python environment¶**

Next, you'll create an isolated datasist development environment:

* Install either Anaconda or miniconda
* Make sure your conda is up to date \(conda update conda\)
* Make sure that you have cloned the repository.

Follow the steps below:

1. cd to the datasit source directory

`cd datasist`

1. Build and install datasist

```text
    python setup.py build
    pip install -e .
```

1. Test that datasist was successfully installed

```python
    import datasist
```

1. If there is no error after the previous command, then you're ready to start contibuting. Now you can fire up your favorite IDE and start implementing your changes.

#### Docstrings Guidelines

Docstrings are an important part of coding and we encourage you to write clear and concise docstrings for your functions, methods and classes. Docstrings written for your code are automatically used to generate the datasist documentation using the **pdoc** library. Some guildlines for writing docstrings are: 1. Define what the function does. 2. Define all parameter types and what they do. 3. State the return values 4. Use the correct spacing and indentation as this affects the documentation generated by **pdoc**.

Sample docstrings:

```python
    def add_df(df1=None, df2=None):
        '''
        A function to add two dataframes together.  

        Parameters:
        ------------
        df1: DataFrame, Series
            The first dataframe to add.

        df1: DataFrame, Series
            The second dataframe to add.

        Returns:
        ---------
            DataFrame: Concatenation of the two dataframe
        '''

        #check if dataframe is None
        if df1 is None:
            raise ValueError('df1: Expected a DataFrame, got None')

        if df2 is None:
            raise ValueError('df1: Expected a DataFrame, got None')

        final_df = df1 + df2

        return final_df
```

**Writing tests**

We strongly encourages contributors to write test for their code. Like many packages, datasist uses pytest.

All tests should go into the tests subdirectory and placed in the corresponding module. The tests folder contains some current examples of tests, and we suggest looking to these for inspiration.

To compare dataframe or series objects, you can use the pandas.util.testing module. The easiest way to verify that your code is correct is to explicitly construct the result you expect \(expected\), then compare it to the actual result \(output\).

**Using pytest**

Here we show an example of a test case we wrote for the **drop\_redundant** function in the feature_engineering module. This test is placed in the **test\_feature\_engineering.py** file inside the \_tests_ folder.

```python
    ...

    def drop_redundant(data):
    '''
    Removes features with the same value in all cell. Drops feature If Nan is the second unique class as well.

    Parameters:
    -----------------------------
        data: DataFrame or named series.

    Returns:

        DataFrame or named series.
    '''

    if data is None:
        raise ValueError("data: Expecting a DataFrame/ numpy2d array, got 'None'")

    #get columns
    cols_2_drop = _nan_in_class(data)
    print("Dropped {}".format(cols_2_drop))
    df = data.drop(cols_2_drop, axis=1)
    return df
```

The corresponding test for the function above is:

```python
import pytest
from datasist import feature_engineering
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

df = pd.DataFrame({'country': ['Nigeria', 'Ghana', 'USA', 'Germany'],
                    'size': [280, 20, 60, np.NaN],
                    'language': ['En', 'En', 'En', np.NaN]})


def test_drop_redundant():
    expected = ['country', 'size']
    output = list(feature_engineering.drop_redundant(df).columns)
    assert expected == output
```

**Running the test case**

To run the test case, navigate the correct test subfolder and open a command prompt. Run the following command.

```text
pytest tests
```

#### Contributing your changes to pandas

**Committing your code**

Once you’ve made changes, you can see them by typing:

```text
git status
```

Next, you can track your changes using

```text
git add .
```

Next, you commit changes using:

```text
git commit -m "Enter any commit message here"
```

**Pushing your changes**

When you want your changes to appear publicly on your GitHub page, you can push to your forked repo with:

```text
git push
```

#### Review your code and finally, make the pull request

If everything looks good, you are ready to make a pull request. A pull request is how code from a local repository becomes available to the GitHub community and can be reviewed and eventually merged into the master version. To submit a pull request:

1. Navigate to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on the Pull Request button
3. Write a description of your changes in the Preview Discussion tab
4. Click Send Pull Request.

This request then goes to the repository maintainers, and they will review the code and everything looks good, merge it with the master.

**Hooray! Youre now a contributor to datasist. Now go bask in the euphoria!**

```python
